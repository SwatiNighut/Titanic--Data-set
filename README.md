# Titanic--Data-set
Titanic data for survival prediction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.



Method used : some functions of python,pandas and techniques of machine learnings.

Hyperparameter tunning : How to perform hyperparameter tunning with GridsearchCV.

conclusion: model gives 85% accuracy. After analysing concluded that higher probabilty of survival is for the women and higher class passengers is more than others.
